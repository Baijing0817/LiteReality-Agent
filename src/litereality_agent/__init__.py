"""Turn a room scan into an editable, realistic 3D program.

The package is organized around a resumable eight-stage pipeline. Dependency direction is
``shared ← scene ← services ← adapters ← pipeline ← cli``; architecture tests enforce it.
The supported entrypoint is ``uv run litereality``. Repository-level ``scripts/`` contains only
operational wrappers and is never imported or shipped in the wheel.

## The two roots

Code and data live in different places, and conflating them is the classic src-layout bug:

    PACKAGE_ROOT   src/litereality_agent — where the CODE is. Use for anything shipped in the wheel:
                   a prompt template, a Blender helper script, a tool a subprocess must exec.
    REPO_ROOT      the checkout — where the DATA is: run/, scans_uploaded/,
                   .env, .key, run.sh. Override with $LR_REPO_ROOT when the package is installed
                   somewhere other than beside its data.

Reach for `REPO_ROOT` when you mean "where this user's scans and results live" and `PACKAGE_ROOT`
when you mean "where our own files are". They are the same directory in a source checkout, which
is exactly why the distinction has to be made deliberately rather than discovered later.
